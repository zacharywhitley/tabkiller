- Context creation initiated

## Completed Work

### Project Setup
- ✅ Repository created and linked to GitHub
- ✅ Claude Code PM system installed
- ✅ Project documentation structure established
- ✅ CLAUDE.md configured with project-specific instructions
- ✅ Context directory structure created

### Documentation
- ✅ README.md with comprehensive PM system documentation
- ✅ AGENTS.md explaining specialized agent architecture
- ✅ COMMANDS.md documenting available workflow commands
- ✅ CLAUDE.md with project-specific guidance

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. First Commit
- Add all initial files to git
- Create first commit establishing project baseline
- Push to origin/main

### 2. Project Initialization
- Run `/pm:init` to configure GitHub integration
- Install required tools (GitHub CLI, gh-sub-issue extension)
- Set up development environment

### 3. Define Project Vision
- Run `/pm:prd-new tabkiller` to create initial Product Requirements Document
- Define core features for browser tab management plugin
- Establish technical architecture decisions

### 4. Technical Foundation
- Choose browser extension framework (Manifest V3)

- Plan NeoDB integration architecture
- Design SSB synchronization approach

## Outstanding Issues

### Technical Decisions Needed
- Browser extension framework selection
- Database schema for NeoDB integration
- Encryption approach for user data
- SingleFile integration strategy
- LLM integration architecture

### Development Environment
- Testing framework selection
- Build system configuration
- Multi-browser development workflow
- Packaging and distribution strategy

## Context Notes

This is a fresh project focused on creating a universal browser plugin for tab and window management. The project aims to solve bookmark limitations by providing intelligent browsing history tracking, session tagging, and AI-powered querying capabilities.

The repository is currently in setup phase with Claude Code PM system providing structured development workflow through spec-driven development approach.
