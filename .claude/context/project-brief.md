# Project Brief

## Project Name
**TabKiller** - Universal Browser Plugin for Intelligent Tab and Window Management

## Project Scope

### What This Project Does
TabKiller is a cross-browser extension that transforms how users manage and interact with their browsing history. Unlike traditional bookmarks or browser history, TabKiller:

- **Tracks Complete Browsing Context:** Records not just pages visited, but navigation patterns, session relationships, and user intent
- **Provides Intelligent Organization:** Automatically and manually tag browsing sessions by purpose, project, or topic
- **Enables Powerful Search:** Natural language queries across browsing history using AI integration
- **Ensures Privacy and Control:** All data encrypted and synchronized using decentralized protocols
- **Preserves Complete Context:** Full page archiving ensures information remains accessible even if original sources change

### Core Problems Solved
1. **Context Loss:** Prevent loss of research threads and browsing context across sessions
2. **Information Retrieval:** Find previously visited information quickly using natural language
3. **Session Management:** Organize browsing activities by purpose and maintain session boundaries
4. **Privacy Concerns:** Maintain complete control over browsing data without relying on corporate servers
5. **Cross-Device Continuity:** Seamless browsing experience across different devices and browsers

## Key Objectives

### Primary Objectives
1. **Reduce Information Discovery Time:** Help users find relevant information 10x faster than traditional methods
2. **Improve Browsing Organization:** Enable systematic organization of browsing activities by purpose and context
3. **Enhance Privacy Control:** Give users complete ownership of their browsing data with end-to-end encryption
4. **Enable Cross-Device Workflows:** Support seamless browsing session continuity across different devices
5. **Provide Actionable Insights:** Help users understand their browsing patterns and optimize their information workflows

### Secondary Objectives
1. **Replace Traditional Bookmarks:** Offer a superior alternative to folder-based bookmark organization
2. **Reduce Browser Resource Usage:** Help users manage tab overload and improve browser performance
3. **Support Collaborative Research:** Enable sharing of curated browsing sessions with team members
4. **Create Learning Opportunities:** Help users track and reflect on their learning and research processes

## Success Criteria

### User Adoption Metrics
- **Install Rate:** 10,000+ active installations within first 6 months
- **Retention Rate:** 70% of users remain active after 30 days
- **Engagement Rate:** 60% of users actively tag browsing sessions
- **Cross-Platform Adoption:** 40% of users install on multiple browsers/devices

### Performance Benchmarks
- **Query Response:** < 500ms for natural language history searches
- **Sync Speed:** < 5 seconds for session updates across devices
- **Storage Efficiency:** < 1MB per 1000 pages tracked
- **Browser Impact:** < 5% performance overhead

### User Satisfaction Indicators
- **Time Savings:** Users report 50%+ reduction in time spent finding information
- **Workflow Integration:** 80% of users incorporate TabKiller into daily workflows
- **Privacy Satisfaction:** 95% of users satisfied with data control and privacy features
- **Feature Utilization:** 70% of users actively use AI querying capabilities

## Technical Approach

### Architecture Strategy
- **Browser Extension:** Manifest V3 for modern browser compatibility
- **Graph Database:** NeoDB for relationship-rich data storage
- **Decentralized Sync:** SSB protocol for privacy-preserving synchronization
- **AI Integration:** LLM APIs for natural language querying and insights
- **Full Page Archiving:** SingleFile integration for complete content preservation

### Development Methodology
- **Spec-Driven Development:** Every feature traced back to explicit specifications
- **Parallel Agent Development:** Multiple specialized agents working simultaneously
- **GitHub-Centric Workflow:** Issues as source of truth for progress tracking
- **Continuous Integration:** Automated testing and validation at every step

## Constraints and Limitations

### Technical Constraints
- **Browser API Limitations:** Must work within extension API boundaries
- **Storage Limits:** Local storage constraints require efficient data management
- **Performance Requirements:** Cannot significantly impact browser performance
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Must function across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge

### Business Constraints
- **Privacy-First Approach:** No data collection or monetization through user data
- **Open Source Components:** Core security components must be auditable
- **Resource Limitations:** Development with minimal external funding
- **Time Constraints:** MVP delivery within 6-month timeframe

### User Experience Constraints
- **Learning Curve:** Must be intuitive for non-technical users
- **Existing Workflow Integration:** Cannot disrupt established browsing habits
- **Performance Transparency:** Users should not notice extension running
- **Data Migration:** Must support import from existing bookmark systems

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Browser API Changes:** Extension APIs may change, requiring adaptation
- **Synchronization Complexity:** SSB integration may prove more complex than anticipated
- **Performance Impact:** Graph database queries could impact browser performance
- **Cross-Browser Variations:** API differences may require platform-specific code

### Market Risks
- **User Adoption:** Privacy-focused features may not resonate with mainstream users
- **Competition:** Large tech companies may develop competing solutions
- **Regulatory Changes:** Browser security policies may restrict extension capabilities
- **Technology Shifts:** Browser architecture changes may obsolete current approach

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Modular Architecture:** Design allows replacing components as requirements change
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Core features work without advanced capabilities
- **Community Building:** Early user feedback drives development priorities
- **Fallback Options:** Alternative approaches prepared for critical dependencies
