# Task: GunDB Core Integration & Data Models

## Description
Replace NeoDB with GunDB graph database implementation to serve as the foundation for TabKiller's data architecture. This task establishes the core data models and basic operations that all other components will depend on.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] GunDB library integrated and configured in the browser extension
- [ ] Data models implemented for browsing sessions, tabs, pages, and navigation relationships
- [ ] IndexedDB backend configured for local storage persistence
- [ ] Basic CRUD operations implemented for all core entities
- [ ] Graph relationships properly modeled (session->tabs, tab->pages, page->navigation)
- [ ] Data validation and error handling implemented
- [ ] Migration utilities created for existing data (if any)

## Technical Details
- Install and configure gun.js library for browser extension environment
- Design schema for core entities:
  - BrowsingSession (id, timestamp, tags, duration)
  - Tab (id, sessionId, url, title, timestamp, metadata)
  - Page (id, url, title, content, timestamp, singleFileData)
  - NavigationRelationship (fromPageId, toPageId, timestamp, type)
- Implement GunDB IndexedDB adapter for persistent local storage
- Create service layer for data access operations
- Handle browser extension security constraints and permissions
- Code locations: src/data/, src/services/gundb/

## Dependencies
- No internal task dependencies (foundation task)
- External: gun.js library, IndexedDB browser API

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 32
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Deployed to staging
