# Task: Web Crypto API + GunDB SEA Integration

## Description
Integrate existing Web Crypto API encryption with GunDB SEA (Security, Encryption & Authorization) to implement AES-GCM data encryption for GunDB operations and use Ed25519 signatures for data integrity verification. Ensure end-to-end encryption through relay servers while maintaining existing encryption capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Integrate Web Crypto API with GunDB SEA for unified encryption layer
- [ ] Implement AES-GCM data encryption for all GunDB operations
- [ ] Use Ed25519 signatures for data integrity verification
- [ ] Ensure end-to-end encryption through relay servers
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility with existing encryption interfaces
- [ ] Implement key derivation and management through GunDB SEA
- [ ] Add encryption/decryption performance benchmarks
- [ ] Verify encrypted data cannot be read by relay servers
- [ ] Implement secure key exchange mechanisms
- [ ] Add comprehensive security audit logging

## Technical Details
This task focuses on integrating cryptographic security between existing Web Crypto API usage and GunDB's Security, Encryption & Authorization (SEA) framework:

### Key Implementation Areas:
1. **Encryption Bridge**: Create adapter layer between Web Crypto API and GunDB SEA
2. **AES-GCM Implementation**: Use GunDB SEA's AES-GCM for symmetric encryption of user data
3. **Ed25519 Signatures**: Implement digital signatures for data integrity and authenticity
4. **Key Management**: Integrate existing key derivation with GunDB SEA's key management
5. **End-to-End Security**: Ensure relay servers cannot decrypt user data
6. **Performance Optimization**: Balance security with performance requirements

### Code Locations Affected:
- Existing Web Crypto API encryption modules
- GunDB configuration and initialization
- Data serialization/deserialization layers
- Authentication and authorization systems
- Relay server communication protocols

### Key Considerations:
- GunDB SEA provides built-in encryption but may need integration with existing Web Crypto patterns
- Ed25519 signatures provide non-repudiation for data integrity
- Key management must work across distributed GunDB network
- Performance impact of encryption/decryption on large browsing datasets
- Backward compatibility with existing encrypted data

## Dependencies
- [001] GunDB Core Integration - requires basic GunDB infrastructure
- [002] Relay Server Setup - requires relay infrastructure for end-to-end testing
- Existing Web Crypto API implementations must be well-documented
- Security requirements and threat model must be clearly defined

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: ~30 hours
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Deployed to staging
