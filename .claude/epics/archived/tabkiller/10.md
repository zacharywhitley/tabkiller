# Task 003: Graph Database Integration

## Description

Integrate NeoDB graph database for storing and querying browsing history relationships. Implement the data layer that transforms tracked events into a graph structure representing user browsing patterns, page relationships, and session flows.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] NeoDB database connection and configuration established
- [ ] Graph schema designed for browsing data (nodes: pages/sessions, edges: navigation/relationships)
- [ ] Event-to-graph transformation pipeline implemented
- [ ] CRUD operations for pages, sessions, and relationships
- [ ] Query interface for common browsing patterns
- [ ] Database encryption layer for sensitive data protection
- [ ] Connection pooling and error handling
- [ ] Local database backup and recovery mechanism
- [ ] Performance optimization for large datasets
- [ ] Unit and integration tests for all database operations

## Technical Details

### Graph Schema Design
**Nodes:**
- `Page`: Represents visited web pages
- `Session`: Represents browsing sessions
- `Tag`: User-defined session or page tags
- `Domain`: Website domains for grouping

**Relationships:**
- `NAVIGATED_TO`: Page-to-page navigation
- `OPENED_IN_TAB`: Tab creation relationships  
- `PART_OF_SESSION`: Page belongs to session
- `TAGGED_WITH`: Page/session associated with tag
- `BELONGS_TO_DOMAIN`: Page belongs to domain

### Database Operations
1. **Write Operations**
   - Insert pages with metadata and encryption
   - Create navigation relationships
   - Update session associations
   - Bulk insert for performance

2. **Read Operations**
   - Find pages by URL, title, or content
   - Traverse navigation paths
   - Query session timelines
   - Search by tags and metadata

3. **Analysis Operations**
   - Most visited pages/domains
   - Browsing pattern analysis
   - Session flow visualization
   - Related page recommendations

### Encryption Strategy
- Sensitive fields (URLs, titles, content) encrypted at rest
- Client-side encryption before database storage
- Key derivation from user master password
- Encrypted indexes for searchability

### Performance Considerations
- Connection pooling for concurrent operations
- Prepared statements for frequent queries
- Index optimization for common access patterns
- Batch operations for bulk data insertion

## Dependencies

- **001 - Extension Foundation**: Requires basic infrastructure and TypeScript configuration

## Effort Estimate

**3 days**

- Day 1: NeoDB setup, connection management, and basic schema
- Day 2: Repository pattern implementation and CRUD operations  
- Day 3: Encryption layer, query optimization, and comprehensive testing

## Definition of Done

1. NeoDB database connects and initializes successfully
2. Graph schema supports all required node and relationship types
3. Event transformation pipeline converts tracking data to graph format
4. All CRUD operations work reliably with proper error handling
5. Encryption protects sensitive data while maintaining searchability
6. Query performance is acceptable for expected data volumes
7. Connection pooling handles concurrent access properly
8. Database backup and recovery mechanisms function correctly
9. Integration tests validate end-to-end data flow
10. Unit tests cover all repository and transformer functions
11. All acceptance criteria validated and checked off
