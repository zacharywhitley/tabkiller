# Task 005: SSB Synchronization Protocol

## Description

Implement Secure Scuttlebutt (SSB) protocol integration for decentralized, peer-to-peer synchronization of encrypted browsing data across multiple devices. This system will enable secure data replication while maintaining complete user control and privacy through end-to-end encryption.

## Acceptance Criteria

### SSB Protocol Integration
- [ ] SSB client library integration with TypeScript bindings
- [ ] Peer identity generation and management system
- [ ] Secure peer discovery and connection establishment
- [ ] Message publishing and replication for browsing data
- [ ] Feed validation and integrity verification

### Synchronization Engine
- [ ] Real-time sync of encrypted browsing sessions across devices
- [ ] Conflict resolution for concurrent data modifications
- [ ] Delta synchronization for bandwidth efficiency
- [ ] Offline-first operation with queue-based sync resumption
- [ ] Configurable sync intervals and bandwidth limits

### Data Consistency & Conflict Resolution
- [ ] Last-writer-wins conflict resolution for simple conflicts
- [ ] Merge strategies for complex browsing session conflicts
- [ ] Version vector implementation for distributed consistency
- [ ] Rollback mechanism for corrupted or invalid sync data
- [ ] Sync status monitoring and user notification system

## Technical Details

### Architecture Components

```typescript
// Core SSB service structure
interface SSBService {
  initialize(identity: SSBIdentity): Promise<void>
  publishMessage(data: EncryptedData): Promise<MessageId>
  replicateWith(peer: PeerId): Promise<ReplicationStatus>
  resolveConflict(local: SyncData, remote: SyncData): Promise<SyncData>
  getReplicationStatus(): Promise<ReplicationHealth>
}

interface SyncData {
  sessionId: string
  encryptedContent: EncryptedData
  timestamp: number
  deviceId: string
  version: number
  checksum: string
}

interface ReplicationHealth {
  connectedPeers: number
  lastSyncTime: Date
  pendingMessages: number
  syncErrors: SyncError[]
}
```

### Implementation Strategy
1. **SSB Foundation**: Integrate SSB protocol library with browser extension environment
2. **Encryption Integration**: Combine encrypted data from Task 004 with SSB messaging
3. **Sync Logic**: Implement intelligent synchronization with conflict resolution
4. **Network Management**: Handle peer discovery, connection management, and offline scenarios

### Peer-to-Peer Architecture
- **Identity Management**: Generate and store SSB keypairs for device identification
- **Feed Replication**: Subscribe to and replicate feeds from trusted devices
- **Message Validation**: Cryptographic verification of all received messages
- **Network Resilience**: Automatic reconnection and sync resumption after network interruptions

### Integration Points
- **NeoDB Layer**: Sync graph database changes across devices
- **Encryption Layer**: Work with encrypted data payloads exclusively
- **UI Components**: Sync status indicators and peer management interface
- **Background Service**: Continuous sync operation without blocking browser

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies
- **Prerequisite**: Task 003 (Graph Database Integration) must be complete
- **Prerequisite**: Task 004 (Encryption & Security Layer) must be complete
- **SSB Protocol Libraries**: JavaScript SSB implementation for browser environments
- **Network APIs**: Browser extension networking permissions and APIs

### External Libraries
- **SSB-JS**: Core Secure Scuttlebutt implementation for JavaScript
- **SSB-Client**: Browser-compatible SSB client libraries
- **Multiserver**: Network transport layer for SSB protocol
- **Pull-Stream**: Streaming data processing for SSB feeds

## Effort Estimate

### Development Time: 3 days
- **Day 1**: SSB protocol integration and peer identity management
- **Day 2**: Synchronization engine and conflict resolution implementation
- **Day 3**: Network resilience, testing, and performance optimization

### Complexity Assessment
- **SSB Integration**: High complexity due to protocol implementation challenges
- **Conflict Resolution**: Medium complexity requiring distributed systems knowledge
- **Network Management**: Medium complexity with focus on browser environment constraints

## Definition of Done

### Functional Completeness
- [ ] Bidirectional sync of browsing data between multiple devices
- [ ] Conflict resolution working for overlapping browsing sessions
- [ ] Sync performance meets < 5-second target for typical data volumes
- [ ] Offline-first operation with reliable sync resumption

### Network & Performance
- [ ] Peer discovery and connection establishment under 30 seconds
- [ ] Delta sync reduces bandwidth usage by 80%+ compared to full sync
- [ ] Background sync operation with minimal CPU impact (< 3%)
- [ ] Graceful handling of network interruptions and reconnection

### Security & Privacy
- [ ] All synced data remains encrypted end-to-end
- [ ] Peer identity verification prevents unauthorized data access
- [ ] No plaintext browsing data transmitted over network
- [ ] SSB feed integrity verification for all received messages

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Multi-device sync scenarios tested and validated
- [ ] Conflict resolution tested with concurrent modifications
- [ ] Network failure scenarios handled gracefully
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met under various network conditions

### Documentation & Monitoring
- [ ] Comprehensive unit tests with 90%+ coverage
- [ ] Integration tests for multi-device scenarios
- [ ] Network protocol documentation and troubleshooting guides
- [ ] Sync monitoring and diagnostic tools for user support

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks
- **SSB Protocol Complexity**: Learning curve and integration challenges
- **Browser Environment Limitations**: Network API constraints in browser extensions
- **Sync Conflicts**: Complex conflict resolution in distributed environment
- **Performance Impact**: Network operations affecting browser responsiveness

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Prototype Early**: Build minimal SSB integration to validate approach
- **Incremental Implementation**: Start with simple sync, add complexity gradually
- **Extensive Testing**: Multi-device testing scenarios from development start
- **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous profiling of network operations

### Fallback Plans
- **Simplified Sync**: Reduce to basic last-writer-wins if complex resolution fails
- **Local-First Priority**: Ensure local functionality works without sync
- **Manual Export/Import**: Provide data portability if automated sync fails
- **Sync Disable Option**: Allow users to disable sync while maintaining local functionality
