# Task: Performance Optimization & Testing

## Description
Final phase of UI implementation focusing on performance optimization, accessibility improvements, and comprehensive testing across all browser plugin interfaces. This includes unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end testing, and cross-browser compatibility validation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- All UI components are optimized for performance with minimal rendering overhead
- Comprehensive test suite covers unit, integration, and e2e scenarios
- Cross-browser compatibility verified across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
- Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA) are met for all interfaces
- Performance benchmarks established and met for key user interactions
- Memory usage and resource consumption are within acceptable limits

## Technical Details
- Implement performance optimizations including lazy loading, virtualization, and efficient re-rendering
- Build comprehensive test suite using Jest, React Testing Library, and Playwright/Cypress
- Set up cross-browser testing automation with BrowserStack or similar
- Implement accessibility testing with axe-core and manual validation
- Create performance monitoring with Web Vitals and custom metrics
- Optimize bundle sizes and implement code splitting where beneficial
- Establish CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and quality gates

## Dependencies
- Task 001: Core Settings Architecture (base components to optimize and test)
- Task 002: History Visualization Components (visualization performance)
- Task 003: Search & Filtering Interface (search performance)
- Task 004: Session Management UI (session handling performance)  
- Task 005: Advanced Features & Integrations (integration testing)
- Task 006: Responsive Design & Accessibility (accessibility foundation)
- Task 007: Privacy & Security Controls (security testing)
- External: Browser extension APIs and limitations
- External: Testing infrastructure and CI/CD setup

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 80
- Parallel: false
