# Task: Repository Layer Refactoring

## Description
Implement GunDB adapters for existing repository interfaces (SessionRepository, TabRepository, NavigationRepository) while maintaining 100% backward API compatibility through adapter layer. Migrate all existing database operations to use GunDB patterns while preserving existing error handling and validation logic.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create GunDB adapters for SessionRepository interface with full API compatibility
- [ ] Create GunDB adapters for TabRepository interface with full API compatibility
- [ ] Create GunDB adapters for NavigationRepository interface with full API compatibility
- [ ] Migrate all existing database operations to use GunDB patterns
- [ ] Preserve existing error handling mechanisms
- [ ] Preserve existing validation logic
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility for all public repository methods
- [ ] Update dependency injection to use new GunDB adapters
- [ ] All existing tests continue to pass without modification
- [ ] Performance benchmarks show no significant regression

## Technical Details
This task focuses on the data access layer refactoring to use GunDB while maintaining existing interfaces:

### Key Implementation Areas:
1. **Repository Adapters**: Create GunDB-specific implementations of existing repository interfaces
2. **Data Mapping**: Implement bidirectional mapping between existing data models and GunDB document structures
3. **Query Translation**: Convert existing query patterns to GunDB's graph traversal patterns
4. **Transaction Handling**: Adapt existing transaction semantics to GunDB's eventual consistency model
5. **Error Mapping**: Translate GunDB errors to existing application error types

### Code Locations Affected:
- Repository interfaces and implementations
- Data access layer configuration
- Dependency injection setup
- Database connection management
- Query builders and data mappers

### Key Considerations:
- GunDB's decentralized nature requires different approaches to queries and transactions
- Eventual consistency model may require adapter logic for immediate read-after-write scenarios
- Graph-based storage requires careful consideration of data relationships and indexing

## Dependencies
- [001] GunDB Core Integration - requires GunDB infrastructure to be established
- Existing repository interfaces and contracts must be well-defined
- Test suites for existing repositories must be comprehensive

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: ~28 hours
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Deployed to staging
