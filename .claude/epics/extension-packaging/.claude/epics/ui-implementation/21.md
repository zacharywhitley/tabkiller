# Task: Cross-Device Sync Implementation

## Description
Implement a robust cross-device synchronization system that enables seamless data sharing across multiple browsers and devices. This includes device pairing and management, CRDT conflict resolution with user-friendly interfaces, and comprehensive sync status visualization to keep users informed about data synchronization state.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Device pairing system with secure authentication and verification
- Visual device management interface showing all connected devices
- CRDT conflict resolution UI for handling data conflicts gracefully
- Real-time sync status indicators throughout the application
- Offline support with queue-based sync when connection restored
- Bandwidth-efficient sync with incremental updates
- Device-specific settings and preferences synchronization

## Technical Details
- Implement device discovery and pairing using GunDB's peer-to-peer capabilities
- Build conflict resolution UI using CRDT merge strategies
- Create sync status components with real-time updates
- Design device management interface with device metadata
- Implement offline queue for pending sync operations
- Add network status detection and adaptive sync behavior
- Create sync progress indicators for large data transfers
- Implement device authentication and secure key exchange

## Dependencies
- Task 001 (GunDB Backend Implementation) must be completed
- Cryptographic libraries for device authentication
- Network connectivity monitoring utilities

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 80
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- Devices can be paired securely with verification process
- Device management interface shows all connected devices with status
- Conflict resolution UI handles data conflicts appropriately
- Sync status is clearly visible throughout the application
- Offline functionality works with proper queuing
- All sync operations are efficient and don't impact performance
- Device authentication is secure and user-friendly
- Unit tests cover sync logic and conflict resolution
- Integration tests verify cross-device data consistency
- Error handling for network failures and sync issues
