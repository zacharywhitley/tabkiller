# Task: Extension Infrastructure Setup

## Description
Set up the foundational browser extension infrastructure including Manifest V3 configuration, React + TypeScript component architecture, build system integration, and development tooling. This establishes the technical foundation for all UI components and extension functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Manifest V3 properly configured with all required permissions
- React + TypeScript development environment working
- Build system producing optimized extension bundle
- Hot reload development workflow functional
- Extension packaging and deployment process established
- Component architecture patterns defined and documented
- Development and production build configurations working
- Extension successfully loads in Chrome/Firefox/Safari

## Technical Details
- Configure Manifest V3 with permissions for tabs, storage, background scripts
- Set up React 18+ with TypeScript and modern JSX transform
- Implement Webpack/Vite build system for extension-specific requirements
- Create development server with hot reload for popup/options pages
- Establish component architecture patterns (hooks, context, state management)
- Configure linting (ESLint) and formatting (Prettier) with extension-specific rules
- Set up testing framework (Jest/Vitest) for React components
- Create extension packaging script for distribution

## Dependencies
- No task dependencies (can run parallel with Task 001)
- External: Node.js, React, TypeScript, build tools
- Technical: Browser extension development knowledge

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 40 (1 week)
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- Extension loads successfully in target browsers
- Development workflow with hot reload working
- Production build generates optimized, installable extension
- All linting and formatting rules enforced
- Component testing framework operational
- Build pipeline documented and reproducible
- Extension manifest validates against browser requirements
- Ready for UI component implementation
