# Task: History Viewer Interface

## Description
Create a comprehensive and intuitive history exploration interface that provides multiple views of browsing history including timeline, relationship graphs, and advanced search capabilities. The interface should offer real-time search results, visual relationship mapping, and seamless navigation through historical browsing patterns.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Timeline view showing chronological browsing history with zoom levels
- Relationship graph view displaying connections between pages and sessions
- Advanced search with real-time filtering and autocomplete
- Multiple visualization modes (list, cards, timeline, graph)
- Export functionality for history data and visualizations
- Bookmark integration and quick actions
- Performance optimization for large datasets
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

## Technical Details
- Implement timeline component with virtualization for performance
- Build interactive graph visualization using D3.js or similar library
- Create advanced search with multiple filter criteria and operators
- Design responsive layout system for different view modes
- Implement real-time search with debouncing and caching
- Add data export functionality (JSON, CSV, PDF)
- Create bookmark management integration
- Implement infinite scrolling and pagination strategies
- Add keyboard navigation and accessibility features

## Dependencies
- Task 001 (GunDB Backend Implementation) must be completed
- Task 004 (Session Management System) for session data integration
- Visualization libraries (D3.js, Chart.js, or similar)
- Search indexing and filtering utilities

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XL
- Hours: 120
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
