# Task: Popup Interface Implementation

## Description
Implement a lightweight popup interface accessible via browser extension icon that provides quick access to essential TabKiller functionality. The popup will show current session status, allow session tagging, display recent sessions overview, and provide quick navigation to browsing history.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Popup opens when clicking extension icon
- Current session status clearly displayed (active/inactive)
- Session tagging interface allows adding/editing tags for current session
- Recent sessions list shows last 10-20 sessions with timestamps and tags
- Quick actions available (start/end session, view full history)
- Responsive design works across different browser popup sizes
- Real-time updates reflect current browsing state
- Smooth performance with no blocking operations

## Technical Details
- Implement React popup component using extension infrastructure from Task 002
- Connect to GunDB data layer from Task 001 for session management
- Create session status indicator with visual feedback
- Build tagging interface with autocomplete from existing tags
- Implement recent sessions list with efficient data loading
- Add quick action buttons for common operations
- Ensure popup remains responsive with async data operations
- Handle edge cases (no data, network issues, first run)

## Dependencies
- Task 001: GunDB Backend Foundation (required for data access)
- Task 002: Extension Infrastructure Setup (required for React/build system)
- External: Extension popup APIs, React UI components

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 40 (1 week)
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- Popup interface fully functional and accessible
- All session management features working correctly
- Recent sessions displaying with proper formatting
- Session tagging system operational with persistence
- Performance meets responsiveness requirements
- Cross-browser compatibility verified
- Component tests covering all functionality
- UI matches design specifications and provides good UX
