# Task: Production Build System

## Description
Enhance the existing webpack configuration to create optimized production builds for distribution across multiple browsers. This task leverages the current TypeScript and React build pipeline while adding production-specific optimizations, asset bundling, and multi-browser packaging capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Production build generates optimized assets <2MB total size
- Separate build targets for Chrome and Firefox with appropriate manifests
- Source maps generated for debugging but excluded from distribution packages
- Build process completes in <5 minutes using webpack caching
- All existing functionality preserved in production builds
- Asset optimization includes minification, tree-shaking, and bundle splitting

## Technical Details
- Extend existing webpack.config.js with production environment settings
- Add webpack optimization plugins (TerserPlugin, CssMinimizerPlugin)
- Implement multi-target builds for Chrome/Firefox manifest differences
- Configure asset optimization and bundle analysis tools
- Set up production environment variable handling
- Maintain compatibility with existing React component structure

## Dependencies
- Existing webpack configuration and build system
- Current manifest.json files for Chrome/Firefox
- TypeScript and React build pipeline
- No external service dependencies

## Effort Estimate  
- Size: M
- Hours: 40
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Production webpack config produces optimized builds <2MB
- [ ] Separate Chrome and Firefox build outputs with correct manifests
- [ ] Build time <5 minutes with appropriate caching
- [ ] Bundle analyzer reports show optimized asset sizes
- [ ] All current extension functionality works in production builds
- [ ] Source maps available for debugging but not in distribution packages
- [ ] Build process documented with commands for manual execution
