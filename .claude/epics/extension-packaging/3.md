# Task: CI/CD Pipeline Implementation

## Description
Implement GitHub Actions workflows for automated building, testing, and publishing to extension stores. This leverages the existing repository structure and test infrastructure to create a fully automated deployment pipeline with manual approval gates for releases.

## Acceptance Criteria
- GitHub Actions workflow automatically builds extension on push/PR
- Automated test execution using existing Jest configuration
- Cross-browser build validation for Chrome and Firefox targets
- Automated publishing to Chrome Web Store and Firefox AMO via official APIs
- Manual approval gates for production releases
- Automated version tagging and changelog generation from git commits
- Rollback capability via GitHub release management

## Technical Details
- Create .github/workflows/ci.yml for automated testing and building
- Create .github/workflows/release.yml for store publishing
- Use Chrome Web Store API and Firefox AMO API for automated submissions
- Implement semantic versioning based on conventional commit messages
- Set up GitHub Secrets for store API credentials
- Configure matrix builds for multiple browser targets
- Add manual approval step before production deployment
- Generate changelogs from git commit history

## Dependencies
- Production build system (Task 1) for generating distribution packages
- Extension store setup (Task 2) for API access and credentials
- Existing Jest test infrastructure
- GitHub repository with Actions enabled
- Store API credentials and developer accounts

## Effort Estimate  
- Size: L
- Hours: 80
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] GitHub Actions CI workflow tests and builds on every push/PR
- [ ] Cross-browser build validation passes for Chrome/Firefox
- [ ] Release workflow publishes to both extension stores automatically
- [ ] Manual approval gates prevent accidental releases
- [ ] Automated version bumping based on conventional commits
- [ ] Changelog generation from commit messages working
- [ ] Rollback process tested and documented
- [ ] Store API integrations functional with proper error handling
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline documentation created for maintainers
