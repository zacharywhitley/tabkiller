# Task: Quality Assurance Automation

## Description
Implement automated testing and quality gates to ensure 100% test pass rate and <1% crash rate in production. This leverages existing Jest infrastructure while adding cross-browser testing, performance validation, and security scanning to maintain high quality releases.

## Acceptance Criteria
- 100% automated test pass rate before any release
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities in production builds
- 99% successful installation rate across Chrome and Firefox
- <1% crash rate in production measurable via browser error reporting
- Cross-browser testing automated for Chrome and Firefox targets
- Performance validation ensures extension installation <30 seconds
- Security scanning integrated into build pipeline

## Technical Details
- Extend existing Jest configuration for production quality gates
- Add cross-browser testing using WebDriver or Puppeteer
- Implement security scanning via npm audit and additional tools
- Add performance testing for installation time and bundle size
- Create quality gate checks in CI/CD pipeline
- Set up crash reporting via browser extension error APIs
- Add installation success rate monitoring
- Implement automated regression testing

## Dependencies
- Production build system (Task 1) for testing production builds
- Existing Jest test infrastructure
- CI/CD pipeline integration for quality gates
- Browser extension error reporting APIs
- Security scanning tools (npm audit, others)

## Effort Estimate  
- Size: L
- Hours: 80
- Parallel: true
