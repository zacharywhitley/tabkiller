# Task: Monitoring & Analytics

## Description
Implement privacy-first monitoring and analytics using existing telemetry patterns and self-hosted solutions. This provides basic installation/usage metrics, error reporting, and performance monitoring without external dependencies while maintaining user privacy.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Basic installation and usage metrics collection via existing patterns
- Error reporting using existing console logging and browser error APIs
- Performance monitoring leveraging existing performance measurement code
- No external analytics services (privacy-first approach)
- Self-hosted or GitHub-based analytics dashboard
- User privacy maintained with minimal data collection
- Metrics useful for improving extension quality and user experience

## Technical Details
- Extend existing telemetry patterns for basic usage tracking
- Implement error reporting via existing console logging infrastructure
- Add performance monitoring using existing performance measurement code
- Create self-hosted analytics dashboard or use GitHub Analytics
- Use localStorage for metrics aggregation before reporting
- Implement privacy-first data collection (no PII, aggregated only)
- Add opt-out functionality in existing privacy settings
- Create metrics visualization for development team

## Dependencies
- Existing telemetry and logging infrastructure
- Current privacy settings UI for opt-out controls
- Performance measurement code already in codebase
- GitHub repository for hosting analytics dashboard
- Browser error reporting APIs

## Effort Estimate  
- Size: S
- Hours: 16
- Parallel: true
