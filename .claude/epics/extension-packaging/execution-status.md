# Execution Status

## Epic: Extension Packaging & Distribution

### Current Status: **ACTIVE** - Parallel Agents Launched

3 ready tasks launched with parallel agents, following critical path dependencies.

## Active Agents

### Issue #28: Production Build System ⚡ **CRITICAL PATH**
- **Status**: Foundation task - parallel execution coordinator launched
- **Dependencies**: None (critical path start)
- **Duration**: 40 hours (1 week)
- **Agent**: Agent-1 (parallel-worker)
- **Work Streams**: 4 parallel streams (webpack config, multi-browser builds, asset optimization, build performance)

### Issue #31: Enhanced Onboarding Experience ✓ **RUNNING PARALLEL**
- **Status**: Parallel task - coordination complete, design implemented 
- **Dependencies**: None (runs independent of foundation)
- **Duration**: 40 hours (1 week)
- **Agent**: Agent-2 (parallel-worker)
- **Work Streams**: 4 parallel streams (welcome screen, progressive settings, tutorial overlays, state management)

### Issue #34: Monitoring & Analytics ✓ **RUNNING PARALLEL**
- **Status**: Parallel task - Stream 1 complete (metrics collection)
- **Dependencies**: None (runs independent of foundation)
- **Duration**: 16 hours (2 days)
- **Agent**: Agent-3 (parallel-worker)
- **Work Streams**: 4 parallel streams (metrics collection ✓, error reporting, privacy controls, analytics dashboard)

## Queued Issues (Waiting for Dependencies)

### Phase 2 - Ready after #28 completes:
- **Issue #29**: Extension Store Setup (depends on #28)
- **Issue #33**: Quality Assurance Automation (depends on #28)

### Phase 3 - Sequential execution:
- **Issue #30**: CI/CD Pipeline Implementation (depends on #28, #29)
- **Issue #32**: Update Management System (depends on #30)

### Final Phase:
- **Issue #35**: Launch Preparation & Documentation (depends on all others)

## Completed
None yet - initial parallel execution in progress.

## Progress Summary

**Current Phase**: Foundation Infrastructure (Phase 1)
**Active Tasks**: 3/8 (Tasks #28, #31, #34)
**Parallel Efficiency**: 100% - no conflicts between current tasks
**Critical Path**: Task #28 → #29 → #30 → #35 (152 hours total)

### Work Stream Status:
- **Production Build System**: 4 streams coordinating (webpack, builds, optimization, performance)
- **Enhanced Onboarding**: Design complete, 4 streams implemented architecturally  
- **Monitoring & Analytics**: Stream 1 complete (metrics collection), 3 streams remaining

## Next Actions

1. Monitor Task #28 completion (critical path blocker)
2. Complete remaining streams for Tasks #31, #34
3. Launch Phase 2 tasks (#29, #33) when #28 completes
4. Sequence Phase 3 tasks based on dependencies
5. Final integration with Task #35

## Coordination Notes

- All agents working in shared branch: `epic/extension-packaging`
- Worktree location: `/Users/zacharywhitley/git/epic-extension-packaging`
- Commit format: `"Issue #XX: [specific change]"`
- No coordination conflicts detected between active parallel tasks
- Task #28 is on critical path - priority monitoring required
