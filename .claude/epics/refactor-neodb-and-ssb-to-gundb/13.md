# Task: GunDB Relay Server Infrastructure

## Description
Set up Node.js GunDB relay servers to enable asynchronous device synchronization, replacing the SSB protocol. This infrastructure will allow TabKiller data to sync across multiple browsers and devices seamlessly.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Node.js GunDB relay server implemented and configured
- [ ] Server deployment configuration created (Docker, cloud deployment)
- [ ] SSL/TLS encryption configured for secure data transmission
- [ ] Server monitoring and health checks implemented
- [ ] Load balancing and scaling configuration established
- [ ] Connection management for multiple clients implemented
- [ ] Server logging and error handling implemented
- [ ] Testing suite for relay server functionality created

## Technical Details
- Implement Node.js server using gun.js relay functionality
- Configure server for production deployment (PM2, Docker, or similar)
- Set up SSL certificates and HTTPS configuration
- Implement server monitoring (health endpoints, metrics collection)
- Create deployment scripts and infrastructure-as-code
- Configure CORS and security headers for browser extension clients
- Set up automated testing for server functionality
- Code locations: server/, deployment/, monitoring/

## Dependencies
- No internal task dependencies (can run parallel with task 001)
- External: Node.js, gun.js server components, hosting infrastructure

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 24
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Deployed to staging
