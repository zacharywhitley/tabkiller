# Task: Sync Protocol Implementation

## Description
Replace SSB synchronization with GunDB's native sync capabilities. This task implements asynchronous sync through relay servers, eliminating the need for devices to be simultaneously online. The implementation will leverage GunDB's built-in CRDT conflict resolution and handle encrypted peer authentication and device pairing.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] SSB synchronization components removed from codebase
- [ ] GunDB native sync protocol implemented
- [ ] Async sync working through relay servers
- [ ] Devices can sync without being online simultaneously
- [ ] CRDT conflict resolution functioning correctly
- [ ] Encrypted peer authentication implemented
- [ ] Device pairing mechanism working
- [ ] Sync latency under 30 seconds via relay servers
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained during transition
- [ ] All sync-related tests passing

## Technical Details
The implementation will replace the existing SSB-based synchronization layer with GunDB's native peer-to-peer sync capabilities. Key areas to modify:
- Remove SSB protocol handlers and connection management
- Implement GunDB relay server configuration
- Add encrypted peer authentication using SEA (Security, Encryption, Authorization)
- Create device pairing workflow for trusted device networks
- Implement CRDT conflict resolution handlers for browsing data
- Update sync status indicators in UI
- Modify data models to work with GunDB's graph structure

Code locations affected:
- Sync service layer
- Authentication components
- Data persistence layer
- UI sync status components

## Dependencies
- Task 002: Relay Server Infrastructure (required for async sync)
- Task 004: Encryption Integration (required for secure peer auth)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: ~26 hours
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Deployed to staging
