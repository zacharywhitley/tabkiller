# Task: Real-Time Reactive Query System

## Description
Replace polling-based updates with GunDB's native reactive queries. This task implements real-time UI updates when data changes locally or syncs remotely, updating UI components to use reactive programming patterns while ensuring cross-browser compatibility.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Polling-based update mechanisms removed
- [ ] GunDB reactive queries implemented
- [ ] Real-time UI updates working for local changes
- [ ] Real-time UI updates working for remote sync changes
- [ ] UI components updated to reactive programming patterns
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility verified
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet requirements
- [ ] Memory leaks prevented in reactive subscriptions
- [ ] Error handling for reactive query failures
- [ ] Graceful degradation when real-time features unavailable

## Technical Details
The implementation will replace the current polling-based system with GunDB's `.on()` reactive listeners. Key areas to modify:
- Replace setInterval/setTimeout polling with GunDB `.on()` subscriptions
- Update React/Vue components to use reactive hooks
- Implement subscription management to prevent memory leaks
- Add reactive query optimization for large datasets
- Create fallback mechanisms for browsers with limited WebRTC support
- Update state management to work with reactive data flows
- Implement debouncing for high-frequency updates

Code locations affected:
- Data query layer
- UI components (browsing history, session views)
- State management
- Service workers
- Real-time notification system

## Dependencies
- Task 001: GunDB Core Integration (required for reactive query foundation)
- Task 003: Repository Layer Refactoring (required for query abstraction)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: ~20 hours
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Deployed to staging
