# Task 007: Performance Optimization & Memory Management

## Description

Implement comprehensive performance optimization and memory management for the TabKiller browser extension. This task focuses on ensuring the extension meets performance benchmarks while maintaining minimal resource impact on the browser and system. The optimization will target database queries, memory usage patterns, CPU utilization, and overall responsiveness.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Performance Benchmarks
- [ ] Extension startup time < 100ms consistently across all browsers
- [ ] Database query response < 50ms for 95% of operations
- [ ] Memory footprint < 50MB under normal usage patterns
- [ ] CPU impact < 5% during background operation
- [ ] Sync operations complete in < 5 seconds for typical data volumes

### Memory Management
- [ ] Implement proper cleanup for event listeners and background processes
- [ ] Database connection pooling with automatic connection lifecycle management
- [ ] Efficient caching with LRU eviction for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Memory leak detection and prevention mechanisms
- [ ] Resource monitoring and automatic garbage collection triggers

### Query Optimization
- [ ] NeoDB query performance analysis and optimization
- [ ] Indexed relationships for common query patterns
- [ ] Batched operations for bulk data processing
- [ ] Lazy loading for large dataset operations
- [ ] Query result caching with intelligent invalidation

### Background Processing
- [ ] Non-blocking background operations using Web Workers where possible
- [ ] Throttled event processing to prevent resource spikes
- [ ] Efficient debouncing for high-frequency browser events
- [ ] Priority-based task scheduling for background operations

## Technical Details

### Performance Monitoring Infrastructure
```typescript
interface PerformanceMetrics {
  startupTime: number;
  queryResponseTimes: number[];
  memoryUsage: MemoryInfo;
  cpuUtilization: number;
  syncDuration: number;
}

class PerformanceMonitor {
  collectMetrics(): PerformanceMetrics;
  identifyBottlenecks(): PerformanceIssue[];
  optimizeQueries(queries: Query[]): OptimizedQuery[];
}
```

### Memory Management Strategy
- **Connection Pooling**: Maintain optimal number of NeoDB connections
- **Cache Management**: LRU cache with configurable size limits and TTL
- **Event Cleanup**: Automatic removal of unused event listeners
- **Background Task Optimization**: Process batches of operations efficiently

### Database Optimization
- **Index Strategy**: Create indexes for common navigation patterns and session queries
- **Query Batching**: Combine multiple related operations into single transactions
- **Result Pagination**: Implement cursor-based pagination for large result sets
- **Schema Optimization**: Optimize node and relationship structures for common access patterns

### Browser-Specific Optimizations
- **Chrome**: Leverage Service Worker optimizations and IndexedDB performance features
- **Firefox**: Optimize for Firefox's WebExtension implementation differences
- **Safari**: Handle Safari's stricter resource limitations and API differences
- **Edge**: Ensure compatibility with Chromium-based improvements

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies
- **Task 002**: Graph Database Integration must be complete for query optimization
- **Task 003**: Encryption & Security infrastructure needed for performance testing of encrypted operations

### Performance Testing Dependencies
- Performance testing framework integration
- Browser automation tools for consistent measurement
- Memory profiling tools and leak detection utilities
- CPU utilization monitoring across different browser engines

## Effort Estimate

**Total Effort: 3 weeks**

- **Week 1**: Performance monitoring setup and baseline measurements
- **Week 2**: Database and query optimization implementation
- **Week 3**: Memory management improvements and browser-specific optimizations

### Breakdown
- Performance monitoring infrastructure: 5 days
- Database query optimization: 4 days
- Memory management implementation: 4 days
- Browser-specific optimizations: 3 days
- Testing and validation: 5 days

## Definition of Done

### Documentation
- [ ] Performance optimization guide for future development
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide for performance issues
- [ ] Memory management best practices documentation
- [ ] Browser-specific optimization notes and considerations

## Risks and Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Browser API Limitations**: Some browsers may have stricter resource constraints
