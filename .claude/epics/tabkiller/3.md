# Task 004: Encryption & Security Layer

## Description

Implement comprehensive client-side encryption and security layer using Web Crypto API to protect all user browsing data. This layer will encrypt data before storage in NeoDB and handle secure key management, ensuring complete user data ownership and privacy protection.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Security Implementation
- [ ] Web Crypto API integration with AES-GCM encryption
- [ ] Secure key generation and derivation using PBKDF2
- [ ] Client-side encryption of all browsing data before NeoDB storage
- [ ] Secure key storage using browser's native secure storage APIs
- [ ] Data integrity verification using HMAC authentication

### Key Management System
- [ ] User password-based key derivation with configurable iterations
- [ ] Secure key rotation mechanism with backward compatibility
- [ ] Export/import functionality for cross-device key sharing
- [ ] Key recovery mechanism with user-controlled backup phrases
- [ ] Session-based key caching with automatic cleanup

### Security Hardening
- [ ] Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation in extension manifest
- [ ] Secure random number generation for all cryptographic operations
- [ ] Memory-safe handling of sensitive data with explicit cleanup
- [ ] Protection against timing attacks in cryptographic operations
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization for all encrypted data

## Technical Details

### Architecture Components

```typescript
// Core encryption service structure
interface EncryptionService {
  generateKey(password: string, salt: Uint8Array): Promise<CryptoKey>
  encrypt(data: any, key: CryptoKey): Promise<EncryptedData>
  decrypt(encryptedData: EncryptedData, key: CryptoKey): Promise<any>
  deriveKey(password: string): Promise<DerivedKey>
  rotateKey(oldKey: CryptoKey, newPassword: string): Promise<CryptoKey>
}

interface EncryptedData {
  data: ArrayBuffer
  iv: Uint8Array
  salt: Uint8Array
  authTag: Uint8Array
  version: string
}
```

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Cryptographic Foundation**: Implement Web Crypto API wrapper with AES-GCM
2. **Key Management**: Build secure key derivation and storage system
3. **Data Protection**: Create encryption layer for NeoDB integration
4. **Security Testing**: Comprehensive security audit and vulnerability testing

### Security Standards Compliance
- **OWASP Guidelines**: Follow web application security best practices
- **Web Crypto API Standards**: Use only standardized cryptographic primitives
- **Browser Security Model**: Leverage extension security boundaries appropriately
- **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: Ensure no plaintext data leaves local storage

### Integration Points
- **NeoDB Layer**: Encrypt data before database operations
- **SSB Protocol**: Prepare encrypted data for peer-to-peer synchronization  
- **UI Components**: Secure password input and key management interfaces
- **Extension Storage**: Utilize browser extension secure storage APIs

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies
- **Prerequisite**: Task 003 (Graph Database Integration) must be complete
- **Web Crypto API**: Native browser cryptographic functionality
- **Extension Storage API**: Browser extension secure storage mechanisms
- **TypeScript**: Strong typing for cryptographic operations

### External Libraries (Minimal)
- **PBKDF2 Implementation**: For key derivation if not available in Web Crypto API
- **Secure Memory Utilities**: For explicit memory cleanup operations
- **Cryptographic Testing**: Test vectors and security validation tools

## Effort Estimate

### Development Time: 2-3 days
- **Day 1**: Web Crypto API integration and key management foundation
- **Day 2**: Encryption service implementation and NeoDB integration
- **Day 3**: Security hardening, testing, and vulnerability assessment

### Complexity Assessment
- **Cryptographic Implementation**: High complexity requiring careful security review
- **Key Management**: Medium complexity with focus on user experience
- **Integration Challenges**: Medium complexity for seamless NeoDB integration

## Definition of Done

### Functional Completeness
- [ ] All browsing data encrypted before NeoDB storage
- [ ] Secure key generation and management system operational
- [ ] Encryption/decryption performance meets < 50ms target
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility verified (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### Security Validation
- [ ] Security audit completed with zero critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] Cryptographic implementation reviewed against OWASP guidelines
- [ ] Key management system tested for secure storage and retrieval
- [ ] Memory safety verified with no sensitive data leakage

### Integration Testing
- [ ] NeoDB integration with encrypted data storage verified
