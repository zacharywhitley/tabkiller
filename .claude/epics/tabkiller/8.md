# Task 001: Extension Foundation & Build System

## Description

Establish the foundational browser extension architecture and build system for the TabKiller project. This includes setting up the manifest, basic extension structure, development workflow, and cross-browser compatibility framework.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Chrome extension manifest v3 configuration complete
- [ ] Firefox WebExtensions compatibility layer implemented
- [ ] Safari extension conversion setup (optional for initial phase)
- [ ] Build system with hot reload for development
- [ ] TypeScript configuration and linting setup
- [ ] Basic popup UI skeleton created
- [ ] Background service worker foundation established
- [ ] Content script injection framework ready
- [ ] Extension loads and activates in Chrome and Firefox
- [ ] Development documentation for local testing

## Technical Details

### Core Components
- **Manifest**: Chrome MV3 with Firefox compatibility shims
- **Build System**: Webpack/Vite with extension-specific plugins
- **Language**: TypeScript with strict configuration
- **UI Framework**: Lightweight framework (React/Vue/Vanilla) for popup
- **Testing**: Jest/Vitest for unit tests, Playwright for e2e

### Architecture
```
src/
├── manifest/
│   ├── chrome.json (Manifest V3)
│   └── firefox.json (WebExtensions)
├── background/
│   └── service-worker.ts
├── content/
│   └── content-script.ts
├── popup/
│   ├── popup.html
│   ├── popup.ts
│   └── styles/
├── shared/
│   └── types.ts
└── utils/
    └── cross-browser.ts
```

### Key Features
1. Cross-browser compatibility layer
2. Hot reload development environment
3. TypeScript strict mode configuration
4. Linting and formatting (ESLint + Prettier)
5. Build optimization for production

## Dependencies

None - this is the foundation task.

## Effort Estimate

**2-3 days**

- Day 1: Manifest setup and basic extension structure
- Day 2: Build system configuration and development workflow
- Day 3: Testing, documentation, and cross-browser validation

## Definition of Done

1. Extension loads successfully in Chrome and Firefox
2. Build system produces optimized bundles for both browsers
3. Hot reload works for all extension components
4. TypeScript compilation passes with no errors
5. Linting and formatting rules enforced
6. Basic popup displays and communicates with background script
7. Content script can be injected and communicates with background
8. Development setup documented in README
9. All acceptance criteria validated and checked off
