# Epic: TabKiller

## Overview

TabKiller is a universal browser extension implementing a privacy-first, intelligent browsing history system. The technical approach centers on a lightweight browser extension that captures browsing events, stores relationships in a local NeoDB graph database, and synchronizes data across devices using the SSB (Secure Scuttlebutt) protocol. The architecture prioritizes local-first operation with end-to-end encryption, ensuring user data ownership while delivering advanced querying and session management capabilities.

## Architecture Decisions

### Core Technology Stack
- **Browser Extension**: Manifest V3 with TypeScript for type safety and modern APIs
- **Graph Database**: NeoDB for relationship-rich storage with efficient querying
- **Synchronization**: SSB protocol for decentralized, encrypted peer-to-peer sync
- **Encryption**: Web Crypto API with AES-GCM for data protection
- **Build System**: Webpack with cross-browser polyfills for universal compatibility

### Design Patterns
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: React to browser events without blocking user interactions
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstract data access layer for NeoDB operations
- **Observer Pattern**: Decouple tracking logic from data persistence
- **Strategy Pattern**: Support multiple sync backends (SSB primary, fallbacks available)

### Key Architectural Decisions
1. **Local-First with Sync**: Primary data storage remains local, sync is enhancement
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without advanced features
3. **Minimal Permissions**: Request only essential browser permissions
4. **Modular Components**: Loosely coupled modules for maintainability and testing

## Technical Approach

### Browser Extension Components
- **Background Service Worker**: Event handling, database operations, sync coordination
- **Content Scripts**: Minimal page interaction for enhanced context capture
- **Extension Popup**: Quick access interface for session tagging and search
- **Options Page**: Comprehensive settings and data management interface

### Data Storage & Sync
- **Local NeoDB Instance**: Embedded graph database for relationship storage
- **Encryption Layer**: Client-side encryption before any data persistence
- **SSB Integration**: Peer-to-peer replication with conflict resolution
- **Cache Management**: Efficient local caching with intelligent eviction

### Core Data Model
```
Nodes: Page, Session, Tag, User, Device
Relationships: NAVIGATED_TO, BELONGS_TO, TAGGED_AS, SYNCED_FROM
Properties: timestamps, metadata, encrypted_content
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Phases
1. **Foundation**: Core extension architecture and basic tracking
2. **Storage**: NeoDB integration with graph operations
3. **Security**: Encryption implementation and key management
4. **Sync**: SSB protocol integration and conflict resolution
5. **Polish**: Performance optimization and user experience refinement

### Risk Mitigation
- **Browser API Stability**: Use feature detection and graceful degradation
- **Performance Impact**: Continuous profiling and optimization during development
- **Sync Complexity**: Start with simple conflict resolution, enhance incrementally
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Automated testing pipeline for all target browsers

### Testing Approach
- **Unit Tests**: Individual component testing with Jest
- **Integration Tests**: Cross-component interaction testing
- **E2E Tests**: Full user workflow testing with Puppeteer
- **Performance Tests**: Memory usage and response time validation

## Dependencies

### External Service Dependencies
- **NeoDB Community Edition**: Open-source graph database engine
- **SSB Protocol Stack**: Existing JavaScript implementations and networking layer
- **Web Extension Polyfill**: Mozilla's cross-browser compatibility library

### Internal Development Dependencies
- **TypeScript Compiler**: Static type checking and modern JavaScript features
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Jest, Puppeteer, and cross-browser testing tools
- **Build Pipeline**: Webpack configuration for extension packaging

### Infrastructure Dependencies
- **No Server Infrastructure**: Purely client-side application
- **No External APIs**: Local-first architecture with optional peer connectivity
- **No Third-Party Services**: Complete independence from external service providers

## Success Criteria (Technical)

### Performance Benchmarks
- Extension startup time < 100ms
- Database query response < 50ms for typical operations
- Memory footprint < 50MB under normal usage
- CPU impact < 5% during background operation

### Quality Gates
- 90%+ test coverage across all components
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities in security audit
- 100% compatibility across target browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Sub-5-second sync time for typical data volumes

### Acceptance Criteria
- Successfully tracks and stores browsing sessions with full relationship context
- Encrypts all user data with user-controlled keys
- Synchronizes data across multiple devices without data loss
- Provides session restoration and intelligent querying capabilities

## Estimated Effort

### Overall Timeline
- **8 months** total development time aligned with PRD constraints
- **Parallel development** using specialized agent architecture
- **Iterative releases** with continuous user feedback integration

### Resource Requirements
- **Solo developer** with AI-assisted development workflow
- **Claude Code PM system** for structured development and task coordination
- **No external team dependencies** for core functionality

### Critical Path Items
1. **NeoDB Integration** (highest technical complexity)
2. **SSB Protocol Implementation** (highest architectural risk)
3. **Cross-Browser Compatibility** (highest testing overhead)
4. **Encryption Security** (highest security criticality)

### Development Acceleration Strategies
- **Leverage Existing Libraries**: Use proven SSB and NeoDB implementations
- **Parallel Agent Development**: Multiple agents working on independent components
- **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing and validation throughout development
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Deliver core value early, enhance incrementally
