# Task: Session Management System

## Description
Implement a comprehensive session management system that automatically detects browsing sessions, provides an intuitive tagging system with autocomplete functionality, and offers a drag-and-drop interface for organizing sessions. The system should intelligently group related browsing activities and allow users to retrospectively categorize their browsing patterns.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Automatic detection of browsing sessions based on time gaps and domain clustering
- Tagging system with autocomplete suggestions based on previous tags and content analysis
- Drag-and-drop interface for moving tabs/pages between sessions
- Session visualization with clear boundaries and metadata
- Ability to merge, split, and rename sessions
- Session persistence across browser restarts
- Integration with GunDB backend for data storage

## Technical Details
- Implement session detection algorithm using temporal and semantic clustering
- Build React components for session visualization and management
- Create tagging system with fuzzy search and autocomplete
- Implement drag-and-drop using HTML5 drag API or React DnD
- Design session data structure compatible with GunDB
- Add session management controls (merge, split, rename, delete)
- Implement real-time updates when sessions change

## Dependencies
- Task 001 (GunDB Backend Implementation) must be completed
- Browser extension core functionality
- React UI framework setup

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 80
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- Sessions are automatically detected and grouped logically
- Users can tag sessions with autocomplete functionality
- Drag-and-drop interface works smoothly for session reorganization
- Session data is properly stored in GunDB
- All session management operations (merge, split, rename) work correctly
- Unit tests cover session detection logic and UI components
- Integration tests verify GunDB persistence
- UI is responsive and accessible
