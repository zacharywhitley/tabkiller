# Task: GunDB Backend Foundation

## Description
Establish the core GunDB integration and database foundation for the TabKiller browser extension. This includes setting up the decentralized database, defining data models for pages/sessions/devices, implementing session detection logic, and creating the fundamental data capture mechanisms that will serve as the foundation for all other features.

## Acceptance Criteria
- GunDB instance configured and running in browser extension context
- Data models defined for pages, sessions, devices, and browsing events
- Session detection algorithm implemented to identify logical browsing sessions
- Data capture service active and recording page visits, tab opens/closes, window events
- Basic encryption layer implemented for sensitive browsing data
- Local data persistence working correctly
- Foundation ready for SSB synchronization layer (implementation in later tasks)

## Technical Details
- Implement GunDB browser bundle integration
- Design normalized data schema for browsing history graph
- Create session boundary detection using time gaps, domain changes, and user intent
- Build event capture service for browser API events (tabs, windows, navigation)
- Implement client-side encryption for all stored data
- Set up local IndexedDB persistence layer via GunDB
- Create basic data access layer with CRUD operations
- Establish foundation patterns for real-time data synchronization

## Dependencies
- No task dependencies (foundation task)
- External: GunDB library, browser extension APIs
- Technical: Manifest V3 permissions for storage and tabs access

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 120 (3 weeks)
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- All unit tests passing for data models and capture services
- GunDB successfully storing and retrieving encrypted browsing data
- Session detection correctly grouping related page visits
- Data capture service recording all required browser events
- Local persistence working across browser restarts
- Code reviewed and documented
- Foundation ready for UI and synchronization layers
