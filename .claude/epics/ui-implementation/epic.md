# Epic: UI Implementation

## Overview

Implement TabKiller as a complete browser extension with GunDB backend and multi-modal UI interface. This epic delivers intelligent browsing history management through session organization, cross-device sync, and privacy-first architecture. The implementation follows a backend-first approach: establish GunDB foundation, build core UI components, then integrate advanced features.

## Architecture Decisions

**Database Choice**: GunDB for unified graph storage and real-time sync
- Eliminates dual-system complexity (NeoDB + SSB)
- Built-in CRDT conflict resolution for cross-device sync
- Zero-knowledge encryption with GunDB SEA

**UI Framework**: React + TypeScript for maintainability and type safety
- Leverage existing webpack build system
- Component-based architecture for popup, options, and history viewer
- Shared state management for real-time updates

**Extension Architecture**: Multi-modal Manifest V3 design
- Lightweight popup for quick actions (session tagging, sync status)
- Full-featured options page for configuration and device management
- Dedicated history viewer for browsing exploration and advanced search

**Data Flow**: Event-driven architecture with reactive updates
- Browser events → Content scripts → Background service → GunDB
- Real-time UI updates via GunDB reactive queries
- Offline-first with automatic sync when connected

## Technical Approach

### Backend Services
**GunDB Integration Layer**
- Database setup with browser extension compatibility
- Encryption wrapper using GunDB SEA + Web Crypto API
- Session detection and automatic browsing data capture
- Cross-device sync with conflict resolution

**Data Models**
- Page entities (URL, title, content hash, timestamps)
- Session entities (logical browsing groups, tags, relationships)
- Device entities (trusted device management, sync preferences)
- User preferences and privacy settings

### Frontend Components
**Popup Interface** (Lightweight - <100ms load time)
- Current session display with quick tagging
- Recent sessions overview (last 10)
- Sync status indicator and device count
- Direct links to history viewer and settings

**Options Page** (Configuration Hub)
- Device pairing and management interface
- Privacy controls and encryption key management
- Data retention policies and sync preferences
- Extension permissions and advanced settings

**History Viewer** (Full-Featured Interface)
- Session timeline with visual organization
- Advanced search with real-time results
- Drag-and-drop tagging and bulk operations
- Cross-device activity visualization

### Infrastructure
**Browser Extension Architecture**
- Manifest V3 service worker for background processing
- Content scripts for page data capture
- Secure message passing between components
- Local storage with encryption for sensitive data

**Performance Optimization**
- Virtualized rendering for large datasets (100k+ pages)
- Debounced search with intelligent caching
- Lazy loading for history viewer components
- Memory-efficient session detection algorithms

## Implementation Strategy

**Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-3)**
- GunDB integration and data models
- Basic session detection and data capture
- Core UI components (popup, options scaffolding)

**Phase 2: Core Features (Weeks 4-6)**
- Session organization and tagging system
- Basic search functionality
- Device pairing and sync infrastructure

**Phase 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 7-9)**
- Full history viewer with advanced search
- Cross-device sync with conflict resolution
- Privacy controls and data management

**Phase 4: Polish & Testing (Weeks 10-12)**
- Performance optimization and accessibility
- Comprehensive testing and bug fixes
- Beta testing and user feedback integration

**Risk Mitigation**
- Start with minimal GunDB implementation to prove concept
- Build UI components with mock data initially for parallel development
- Implement progressive enhancement for cross-browser compatibility
- Continuous performance monitoring throughout development

## Task Breakdown Preview
