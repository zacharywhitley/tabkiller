# Issue #41 Analysis: React Architecture

## Parallel Work Streams

This task can be broken down into 4 independent parallel streams:

### Stream A: Core React Setup & Infrastructure
**Files:** `src/ui/`, React entry points, main configuration
**Work:**
- Set up React application structure for extension context
- Configure React for popup, options, and history pages
- Implement error boundaries and StrictMode
- Create main App components for each extension context
- Set up TypeScript integration for React

**Deliverables:**
- React application entry points
- Basic App components for popup/options/history
- Error boundary implementations
- Extension-specific React configuration

### Stream B: State Management & Context
**Files:** `src/contexts/`, `src/hooks/`, state management utilities
**Work:**
- Implement Context API providers for global state
- Create contexts for tabs, sessions, settings, and UI state
- Build custom hooks for extension-specific functionality
- Set up state persistence with extension storage
- Create state management utilities and helpers

**Deliverables:**
- Context providers (TabContext, SessionContext, SettingsContext)
- Custom hooks for state management
- Storage integration utilities
- State persistence mechanisms

### Stream C: Routing & Navigation
**Files:** `src/router/`, navigation components, route definitions
**Work:**
- Set up React Router for multi-page navigation
- Create route definitions for different extension pages
- Implement navigation components and breadcrumbs
- Handle extension-specific routing constraints
- Add deep linking support where applicable

**Deliverables:**
- Router configuration
- Route components and definitions
- Navigation components
- Extension context-aware routing

### Stream D: Component Library & Design System
**Files:** `src/components/`, styling system, UI foundations
**Work:**
- Create reusable component library
- Implement consistent design system
- Set up CSS-in-JS or CSS modules
- Build foundation components (buttons, forms, layouts)
- Create extension-specific UI patterns

**Deliverables:**
- Component library with consistent styling
- Design system tokens and utilities
- Layout and navigation components
- Form and input components
- Extension-themed UI components

## Dependencies Between Streams
- **Stream A** provides foundation for all others
- **Stream B & C** can work in parallel after Stream A
- **Stream D** can work independently and integrate with others
- Integration happens when combining all components

## Coordination Points
- All streams coordinate on project structure and naming
- Stream A defines the overall architecture others follow
- Stream B provides state hooks that Stream C & D consume
- Stream D provides components that Stream C uses for navigation

## Success Criteria
- React renders correctly in all extension contexts
- State management works seamlessly across components
- Routing enables navigation between different views
- Components follow consistent design patterns
- Hot reload works for efficient development
- TypeScript compilation succeeds without errors
