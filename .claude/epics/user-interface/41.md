# Task: React Architecture

## Overview
Establish the React application structure with state management, routing, and component hierarchy for the browser extension's user interface.

## Objectives
- Set up React application within extension context
- Implement state management using React Context API
- Create routing system for extension pages
- Establish component hierarchy and design system
- Configure development environment with hot reload

## Deliverables
1. **React setup** - React application configured for extension environment
2. **State management** - Context providers for global state
3. **Routing system** - Navigation between popup, options, and history pages
4. **Component library** - Reusable UI components following design system
5. **Development tools** - Hot reload and debugging configuration

## Technical Requirements
- React 18+ with hooks and function components
- Context API for state management (tabs, sessions, settings)
- React Router for multi-page navigation
- Component library with consistent styling
- TypeScript integration for type safety
- CSS-in-JS or CSS modules for styling

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] React renders correctly in extension popup
- [ ] React renders correctly in extension options page
- [ ] State management works across all extension contexts
- [ ] Routing navigates between different views
- [ ] Components follow consistent design patterns
- [ ] Hot reload works in development mode
- [ ] TypeScript compilation succeeds without errors

## Implementation Notes
- Use React.StrictMode for development warnings
- Implement error boundaries for graceful failure handling
- Create custom hooks for extension-specific functionality
- Set up component testing with React Testing Library
- Consider memory constraints in extension environment
