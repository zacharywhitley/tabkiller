# Issue #42 Analysis: Session Management

## Parallel Work Streams

This task can be broken down into 4 parallel streams:

### Stream A: Session Detection Algorithm
**Files:** `src/session/detection/`, algorithm core, analytics
**Work:**
- Implement intelligent session boundary detection
- Analyze time gaps, domain changes, and user behavior patterns
- Create configurable detection parameters
- Build session boundary prediction logic
- Implement automatic session creation triggers

**Deliverables:**
- Core detection algorithm
- Behavior analysis utilities
- Session boundary prediction
- Configuration management
- Analytics and metrics

### Stream B: Tab Lifecycle Tracking
**Files:** `src/session/tracking/`, event handlers, tab monitoring
**Work:**
- Real-time tab event monitoring (created, updated, removed, activated)
- Tab navigation history tracking
- Background processing for continuous monitoring
- Event debouncing and performance optimization
- Cross-context data synchronization

**Deliverables:**
- Tab event listeners and handlers
- Navigation history tracking
- Performance-optimized event processing
- Background service integration
- Real-time data sync

### Stream C: Storage & Persistence Layer
**Files:** `src/session/storage/`, IndexedDB schema, data management
**Work:**
- IndexedDB schema design for sessions, tabs, navigation events
- Data persistence and retrieval operations
- Session data serialization and compression
- Data export/import functionality
- Storage migration and versioning

**Deliverables:**
- IndexedDB schema and migration
- Data persistence operations
- Storage optimization utilities
- Export/import functionality
- Data integrity and backup

### Stream D: Session Management UI
**Files:** `src/ui/session/`, React components, UI interactions
**Work:**
- Session management interface components
- Session creation and tagging UI
- Session viewing and editing interfaces
- Tag autocomplete and search functionality
- Session merging and splitting UI

**Deliverables:**
- Session management React components
- Tagging interface with autocomplete
- Session visualization components
- Search and filter functionality
- User interaction handlers

## Dependencies Between Streams
- **Stream A & B** can work in parallel (detection + tracking are complementary)
- **Stream C** provides storage foundation for A & B but can develop schema in parallel
- **Stream D** depends on data models from A, B, C but can build UI framework in parallel
- Integration happens when combining all components

## Coordination Points
- Stream A & B coordinate on session boundary events
- Stream C provides data models that A & B write to and D reads from
- All streams coordinate on session data structure and event types
- Stream D integrates with existing React architecture from Issue #41

## Success Criteria
- Session boundaries detected automatically with high accuracy
- All tab lifecycle events captured without performance impact
- Session data persists reliably across browser sessions
- User interface provides intuitive session management
- System scales efficiently with large numbers of tabs and sessions
- Integration with existing React state management is seamless
