# Task: Session Management

## Overview
Implement session boundary detection algorithm, session creation and tagging functionality, along with comprehensive tab lifecycle tracking integrated with IndexedDB storage.

## Objectives
- Develop intelligent session boundary detection
- Create session creation and user tagging system
- Implement comprehensive tab lifecycle tracking
- Integrate with IndexedDB for persistent storage
- Build session management UI components

## Deliverables
1. **Session detection algorithm** - Logic to identify natural session boundaries
2. **Session creation system** - User-initiated and automatic session creation
3. **Session tagging interface** - UI for adding tags and descriptions to sessions
4. **Tab lifecycle tracking** - Monitor tab creation, navigation, and closure
5. **IndexedDB integration** - Persistent storage for session data
6. **Session management UI** - Interface for viewing and managing sessions

## Technical Requirements
- Session boundary detection based on time gaps, domain changes, and user behavior
- Real-time tab event monitoring (created, updated, removed, activated)
- IndexedDB schema for sessions, tabs, and navigation events
- Session tagging with autocomplete and categorization
- Background processing for continuous tracking
- Data synchronization between extension contexts

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Session boundaries are detected automatically based on user behavior
- [ ] Users can manually create and tag sessions
- [ ] All tab lifecycle events are captured and stored
- [ ] Session data persists across browser restarts
- [ ] Session management UI displays current and historical sessions
- [ ] Tab navigation history is accurately recorded
- [ ] Session tags support autocomplete and search functionality
- [ ] Background tracking works without impacting browser performance

## Implementation Notes
- Use browser.tabs API for tab monitoring
- Implement debouncing for high-frequency events
- Consider privacy implications of data collection
- Design for scalability with large numbers of tabs/sessions
- Include data export/import functionality
- Implement session merging and splitting capabilities
