# Issue #43 Analysis: Timeline Visualization

## Parallel Work Streams

This task can be broken down into 3 parallel streams:

### Stream A: Virtual Scrolling & Performance Core
**Files:** `src/ui/timeline/core/`, virtual scrolling, performance optimization
**Work:**
- Implement high-performance virtual scrolling component
- Create efficient data structures for timeline navigation
- Build performance optimization utilities (memoization, lazy loading)
- Implement binary search for position lookup
- Add performance monitoring and metrics

**Deliverables:**
- Virtual scrolling component handling 100k+ entries
- Efficient timeline data structures
- Performance monitoring and optimization utilities
- Memory management and cleanup systems
- Smooth 60fps scrolling implementation

### Stream B: Timeline Visualization & Session Grouping
**Files:** `src/ui/timeline/visualization/`, timeline components, session UI
**Work:**
- Create git-style timeline visualization component
- Implement session grouping with collapsible containers
- Build session metadata display and drill-down functionality
- Design timeline branching and merging visualizations
- Add session relationship indicators

**Deliverables:**
- Git-style timeline visualization component
- Session grouping and container components
- Session metadata and drill-down interfaces
- Timeline branching visualization
- Session relationship indicators

### Stream C: Search, Filtering & Navigation
**Files:** `src/ui/timeline/search/`, filtering, navigation controls
**Work:**
- Build comprehensive search and filtering system
- Implement multi-criteria filtering with real-time results
- Create navigation controls (scrubbing, zoom, jump-to-date)
- Add search indexing for fast operations
- Build responsive design for various screen sizes

**Deliverables:**
- Advanced search and filtering system
- Real-time filtering with <200ms performance
- Timeline navigation controls
- Search indexing and optimization
- Responsive design implementation

## Dependencies Between Streams
- **Stream A** provides the performance foundation that B & C build upon
- **Stream B & C** can work in parallel after A establishes virtual scrolling
- All streams coordinate on data formats and component interfaces
- Integration with existing React architecture and session management

## Coordination Points
- Stream A defines the virtual scrolling interface that B uses for rendering
- Stream B provides timeline data structures that C uses for filtering
- Stream C provides search results that B displays in the timeline
- All streams integrate with existing session data from Issue #42

## Success Criteria
- Timeline renders 100k+ entries with smooth performance
- Virtual scrolling maintains 60fps without memory issues
- Session grouping enables intuitive drill-down navigation
- Search and filtering respond in <200ms for large datasets
- Timeline supports multiple zoom levels and time ranges
- Component is fully accessible and responsive
- Integration with existing session management is seamless
