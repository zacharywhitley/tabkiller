# Task: Timeline Visualization

## Overview
Implement a git-style timeline visualization component for browsing history with virtual scrolling, session grouping, and advanced filtering capabilities optimized for handling 100k+ entries.

## Objectives
- Create performant timeline visualization using virtual scrolling
- Implement session grouping with drill-down functionality
- Add comprehensive search and filtering capabilities
- Optimize rendering performance for large datasets
- Design intuitive navigation and interaction patterns

## Deliverables
1. **Virtual scrolling component** - High-performance list rendering for large datasets
2. **Timeline visualization** - Git-style timeline with branch-like session flows
3. **Session grouping** - Collapsible session containers with metadata
4. **Search and filter system** - Multi-criteria filtering with real-time results
5. **Navigation controls** - Timeline scrubbing, zoom, and jump-to-date
6. **Performance optimizations** - Lazy loading, memoization, and efficient re-rendering

## Technical Requirements
- Virtual scrolling for 100k+ entries without performance degradation
- React/Vue component architecture with state management
- Efficient data structures for timeline navigation
- Search indexing for fast filtering operations
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Timeline renders 100k+ entries without lag
- [ ] Virtual scrolling maintains smooth 60fps scrolling
- [ ] Session grouping allows drill-down to individual pages
- [ ] Search filters results in <200ms for large datasets
- [ ] Timeline supports zooming from hours to months view
- [ ] Navigation preserves state during filtering operations
- [ ] Component passes accessibility audit
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable during extended use

## Implementation Notes
- Use react-virtualized or similar for virtual scrolling
- Implement binary search for timeline position lookup
- Consider Web Workers for heavy filtering operations
- Use IndexedDB for client-side search indexing
- Implement progressive loading for better perceived performance
