# Task: GunDB Sync Integration

## Description
Integrate GunDB for real-time cross-device synchronization of browsing data, ensuring seamless data availability across all user devices with robust offline functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] GunDB integration successfully syncs browsing sessions across devices
- [ ] Offline functionality maintains full app usability without network
- [ ] Automatic sync resumes when network connection restored
- [ ] Sync conflicts resolved using last-write-wins with timestamp priority
- [ ] Data consistency maintained during concurrent updates from multiple devices
- [ ] Sync status indicators show connection state and sync progress in UI
- [ ] Encryption maintained during sync operations
- [ ] Performance remains optimal with large datasets

## Implementation Details

### Core Integration
- Set up GunDB peer network for decentralized sync
- Configure relay servers for improved connectivity
- Implement data schema mapping between local NeoDB and GunDB
- Add sync middleware layer for data transformation

### Offline Support
- Implement offline queue for pending sync operations
- Add conflict resolution logic for competing updates
- Create sync recovery mechanism for interrupted operations
- Build data integrity validation after sync completion

### UI Integration
- Add sync status indicator to navigation bar
- Implement sync progress notifications
- Create sync settings panel for user configuration
- Add manual sync trigger for user control

### Error Handling
- Network connectivity monitoring and retry logic
- Graceful degradation when sync services unavailable
- User-friendly error messages for sync failures
- Automatic fallback to local-only mode when needed

## Technical Requirements
- Maintain end-to-end encryption during sync
- Implement efficient delta sync to minimize bandwidth
- Add sync audit logging for debugging
- Ensure GDPR compliance for cross-border sync
- Support for multiple device types and browsers

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for sync logic and conflict resolution
- Integration tests with multiple simulated devices
- Network interruption and recovery testing
- Load testing with large browsing history datasets
- Security testing for encryption during sync

## Dependencies
- Task 002: Local Storage System (NeoDB integration required)
- Task 003: Session Management (session data structure needed)
- Task 004: Content Preservation (data format for sync)
- Task 005: Search and Navigation (search index sync required)

## Estimated Size
Large (L) - Complex integration requiring distributed systems knowledge

## Risk Factors
- Network reliability and performance variations
- Data consistency challenges in distributed environment
- Potential conflicts with browser security policies
- Scalability concerns with large user bases
