# Epic: User Interface

## Overview

Implement a React-based browser extension user interface with three core components: sidebar panel for session management, dedicated analysis page with git-style timeline visualization, and context menu integration. The interface will provide real-time tab tracking, session boundary detection, and cross-browser compatibility while leveraging existing NeoDB and GunDB infrastructure.

## Architecture Decisions

- **Frontend Framework**: React for component reusability and cross-browser consistency
- **Extension Architecture**: Manifest V3 with background service worker and content scripts
- **State Management**: React Context API with local storage persistence, synced via GunDB
- **UI Library**: Custom components optimized for browser extension constraints
- **Timeline Visualization**: Virtual scrolling with canvas-based rendering for performance
- **Cross-Browser Support**: Abstract browser APIs through adapter pattern

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components

**Core UI Components:**
- `SidebarPanel`: Collapsible sidebar with current session status and quick actions
- `TimelineView`: Git-style timeline with virtualized rendering for large datasets
- `SessionManager`: Session creation, tagging, and boundary management
- `ContextMenus`: Browser context menu integration for settings access

**State Management:**
- Central store using React Context for session data, timeline state, and user preferences
- Local IndexedDB storage with GunDB sync for cross-device consistency
- Real-time tab event listeners with debounced state updates

**User Interaction Patterns:**
- Keyboard shortcuts for quick session switching and timeline navigation
- Drag-and-drop for session organization and tab grouping
- Progressive disclosure for timeline drill-down capabilities

### Backend Services

**Browser Extension APIs:**
- `chrome.tabs` / `browser.tabs` for tab lifecycle tracking
- `chrome.windows` / `browser.windows` for session restoration
- `chrome.contextMenus` / `browser.contextMenus` for right-click integration
- `chrome.storage` / `browser.storage` for local data persistence

**Data Models:**
- Session: `{ id, name, tags, startTime, endTime, tabs[], metadata }`
- Tab: `{ id, url, title, parentId, sessionId, visitTime, status }`
- Timeline: `{ sessions[], relationships[], filters, viewState }`

**Business Logic:**
- Session boundary detection algorithm combining time gaps, domain clustering, and manual tags
- Tab relationship tracking for parent-child navigation paths
- Background tab monitoring with minimal performance impact

### Infrastructure

**Extension Deployment:**
- Multi-browser build pipeline for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- Manifest V3 compatibility with V2 fallback for older browsers
- Hot-reload development environment

**Performance Optimization:**
- Virtual scrolling for timeline rendering (handle 100k+ entries)
- Lazy loading for historical data with progressive enhancement
- Web Workers for intensive operations (session detection, data sync)

**Monitoring:**
- Error boundary components with local error logging
- Performance metrics collection (load times, memory usage)
- User interaction analytics (session creation, timeline usage)

## Implementation Strategy

**Phase 1 - Core Infrastructure (Weeks 1-2)**
- Browser extension manifest and basic React setup
- Cross-browser API abstraction layer
- Basic sidebar panel with session display

**Phase 2 - Session Management (Weeks 3-4)**
- Session boundary detection algorithm
- Manual session creation and tagging
- Tab lifecycle tracking and persistence

**Phase 3 - Timeline Visualization (Weeks 5-6)**
- Git-style timeline component with virtual scrolling
- Session grouping and drill-down functionality
- Search and filtering capabilities

**Phase 4 - Integration & Polish (Weeks 7-8)**
- GunDB sync integration
- Context menu implementation
- Cross-browser testing and optimization

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Prototype timeline rendering early to validate performance
- Create browser API adapter to isolate cross-browser differences
- Implement progressive enhancement for optional features

**Testing Approach:**
- Unit tests for React components and business logic
- Integration tests for browser extension APIs
- End-to-end tests for critical user workflows
- Manual testing across target browsers

## Task Breakdown Preview

High-level task categories that will be created:
- [ ] Extension Infrastructure: Manifest setup, build pipeline, cross-browser adapter
- [ ] React Architecture: Component structure, state management, routing
- [ ] Session Management: Boundary detection, tagging, persistence
- [ ] Timeline Visualization: Git-style timeline, virtual scrolling, interactions
- [ ] Sidebar Panel: Current session display, quick actions, responsive design
- [ ] Context Menu Integration: Settings access, browser API integration
- [ ] GunDB Sync: Real-time sync, offline handling, conflict resolution
- [ ] Performance Optimization: Virtual scrolling, lazy loading, memory management
- [ ] Cross-Browser Testing: API compatibility, UI consistency, feature parity
- [ ] SingleFile Integration: Page saving, management, preview capabilities

## Dependencies

**External Dependencies:**
- NeoDB for tab relationship storage and querying
- GunDB for real-time sync across devices
- SingleFile library for page archiving functionality
- Browser extension APIs (tabs, windows, contextMenus, storage)

**Internal Dependencies:**
- Backend team for NeoDB schema design and API endpoints
- QA team for cross-browser testing infrastructure
- Existing tabkiller core functionality for data models

**Prerequisite Work:**
- NeoDB integration must be functional for relationship tracking
- GunDB sync infrastructure needs basic implementation
- Browser extension manifest and permissions setup

## Success Criteria (Technical)

**Performance Benchmarks:**
- Timeline rendering < 1 second for 10,000+ entries
- Sidebar panel load time < 200ms
- Memory usage < 50MB for background processes
- Real-time tab tracking latency < 100ms

**Quality Gates:**
- 90% code coverage for React components
- Zero browser console errors in production
- Cross-browser compatibility across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- Accessibility compliance for keyboard navigation

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users can create and manage tagged sessions
- Timeline displays all page visits with session grouping
- Sidebar shows current session status in real-time
- Context menus provide access to key settings
- GunDB sync maintains data consistency across devices

## Estimated Effort

**Overall Timeline:** 8 weeks for MVP implementation

**Resource Requirements:**
- 1 Frontend developer (full-time)
- 0.25 Backend developer (for integration support)
- 0.25 QA engineer (for testing coordination)

**Critical Path Items:**
- Timeline visualization performance (Week 5-6)
- Cross-browser API compatibility (Week 7)
- GunDB integration and sync reliability (Week 8)

**Risk Factors:**
- Browser API inconsistencies may require additional development time
- Timeline performance with large datasets may need architectural changes
- SingleFile integration complexity unknown until implementation
