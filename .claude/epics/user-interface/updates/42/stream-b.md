// Get real-time metrics
const metrics = tabTracking.getMetrics();
console.log('Events processed:', metrics.eventsProcessed);
console.log('Average processing time:', metrics.averageProcessingTime);
console.log('Memory usage:', metrics.memoryUsage);

// Get navigation history
const history = tabTracking.getNavigationHistory(tabId);

// Get active tab states
const tabStates = tabTracking.getActiveTabStates();
console.log('Tracked tabs:', tabStates.size);
```

### Configuration Management

// Update configuration dynamically
await tabTracking.updateConfiguration({
  debounceTimeout: 200,
  maxHistoryEntries: 5000,
  enableRealTimeSync: true
