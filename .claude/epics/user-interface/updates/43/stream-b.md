## Data Structures

### Timeline Visualization Data Flow
```typescript
BrowsingSession[] → TimelineSession[] → TimelineVisualizationItem[]
                 ↓
            Session Grouping & Visual Layout
                 ↓
            Git-style Rendering with Relationships
```

### Key Type Definitions
- `TimelineVisualizationItem`: Enhanced timeline items with position/relationship data
- `TimelineSession`: Session containers with visual metadata and statistics
- `SessionBranch`: Individual branches within sessions for git-style visualization
- `ItemRelationships`: Parent-child, sibling, and related item connections

## Testing Considerations
