# PRD: Extension Packaging & Distribution

## Executive Summary

Establish production-ready packaging, distribution, and deployment infrastructure for the TabKiller browser extension. This includes build system validation, extension store submissions, automated CI/CD pipelines, user onboarding flows, and update mechanisms to deliver a seamless installation and update experience across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge browsers.

**Value Proposition:** Transform the completed TabKiller extension from development code into a production-ready, distributable product that users can easily install, configure, and automatically update across multiple browser platforms.

## Problem Statement

### Current State
- TabKiller extension is fully implemented with comprehensive UI, GunDB backend, session management, cross-device sync, and privacy controls
- Development builds exist but haven't been validated for production distribution
- No automated build pipeline or quality gates for releases
- No extension store presence or distribution channels
- No user onboarding flow for first-time setup
- No update mechanism or version management strategy

### Problems to Solve
1. **Deployment Gap**: Complete extension exists but can't be installed by end users
2. **Quality Assurance**: No validation that production builds work across target browsers
3. **Distribution Bottleneck**: Manual build and release processes prevent rapid iteration
4. **User Adoption Barrier**: No guided setup experience for complex features like cross-device sync
5. **Maintenance Overhead**: No automated update delivery or rollback mechanisms

### Why Now?
- UI implementation epic just completed - extension is feature-complete for v1.0
- Need user feedback to validate product-market fit before building additional features
- Extension stores have review processes that can take weeks - must start immediately
- Foundation for all future releases and user acquisition

## User Stories

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- **Extension Store Policies**: Must comply with Chrome Web Store, AMO, and other store policies
- **Browser API Limitations**: Different browsers have different extension capabilities
- **Manifest V3 Requirements**: Chrome's Manifest V3 restrictions on background scripts
- **File Size Limits**: Extension stores have package size limitations
- **Review Process**: Extension stores may take 1-14 days for review

### Business Constraints
- **Budget**: Limited budget for paid services (analytics, CDN, signing certificates)
- **Timeline**: Need to launch within 8 weeks to capture user feedback
- **Team Size**: Small development team limits parallel work capacity
- **Legal**: Privacy compliance requirements (GDPR, CCPA) for any telemetry

### Assumptions
- Current UI implementation is stable and ready for production
- Users will adopt cross-device sync if setup process is simple enough
- Extension store approval processes won't require major code changes
- Development team has necessary accounts/credentials for extension stores
- Current webpack build system can be adapted for production packaging

## Out of Scope

### Explicitly NOT Included in This Epic
- **Mobile App Development**: Focus only on desktop browser extensions
- **Website Landing Page**: No marketing website or landing page creation
- **User Support System**: No helpdesk or customer support infrastructure
- **Advanced Analytics**: No detailed user behavior analytics beyond basic metrics
- **Monetization Features**: No premium features, subscriptions, or payment processing
- **Enterprise Features**: No single sign-on, admin controls, or enterprise deployment
- **Localization**: English-only for initial release (other languages in future)
- **API Documentation**: No public APIs or developer documentation

### Future Considerations
- Mobile companion apps
- Enterprise deployment features
- Advanced analytics and business intelligence
- Third-party integrations (bookmark sync, password managers)
- White-label or custom deployment options

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- **Extension Store Accounts**: Chrome Web Store, AMO, Safari App Store, Edge Add-ons developer accounts
- **Code Signing Certificates**: For secure distribution and updates
- **CDN Service**: For reliable update delivery (consider GitHub Releases, Cloudflare)
- **Analytics Service**: Privacy-friendly analytics (consider Plausible, self-hosted)
- **Error Reporting**: Crash/error monitoring service (consider Sentry, self-hosted)

### Internal Dependencies
- **DevOps Setup**: GitHub Actions configuration and secrets management
- **QA Process**: Testing procedures and acceptance criteria
- **Legal Review**: Privacy policy updates for any telemetry collection
- **Design Assets**: Extension store screenshots, icons, promotional materials

### Critical Path Dependencies
1. **Developer Accounts**: Must establish extension store accounts before submission
2. **Code Signing**: Certificates required for trusted distribution
3. **Build System**: Must complete build pipeline before store submissions
4. **Testing Infrastructure**: Required for quality assurance before release
