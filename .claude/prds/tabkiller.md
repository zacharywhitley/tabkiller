# PRD: TabKiller

## Executive Summary

TabKiller is a universal browser extension that revolutionizes how users manage and interact with their browsing history by providing intelligent organization, powerful search capabilities, and complete privacy control. Unlike traditional bookmarks or browser history, TabKiller transforms browsing data into a dynamic, relationship-aware system that understands user context and intent while maintaining complete user data ownership through decentralized synchronization.

## Problem Statement

### What problem are we solving?

Modern web users face significant challenges in managing their digital information consumption:

1. **Context Loss**: Users lose track of research threads and browsing context when switching between sessions, devices, or projects
2. **Information Retrieval Inefficiency**: Finding previously visited information requires remembering specific URLs or manually browsing through chronological history
3. **Relationship Blindness**: Traditional bookmarks and history don't capture the relationships between pages or the context of why they were visited
4. **Privacy Concerns**: Browser history and bookmarks are stored on corporate servers, giving users no control over their browsing data
5. **Cross-Device Fragmentation**: Browsing sessions are isolated to individual devices, breaking workflow continuity

### Why is this important now?

- Information workers spend 20-30% of their time searching for previously encountered information
- Browser tab overload is causing performance issues and user stress
- Privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA) are increasing user awareness of data ownership rights
- Remote work has increased the need for cross-device workflow continuity
- AI capabilities enable natural language querying of personal data for the first time

## User Stories

### Primary User Personas

#### The Information Worker
**Profile**: Knowledge workers, researchers, consultants who manage complex research projects

**User Story**: "As an information worker, I want to organize my browsing by project context so that I can quickly resume research threads and find related information without losing my place."

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Can tag browsing sessions with project labels
- Can search browsing history using natural language queries
- Can see relationships between pages visited in different sessions
- Can restore complete browsing sessions across browser restarts

#### The Heavy Browser User
**Profile**: Power users, developers, content creators who maintain dozens of open tabs

**User Story**: "As a heavy browser user, I want to efficiently manage my tabs without losing important context so that my browser performs well while preserving my workflow state."

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Can close tabs while preserving their context in browsing history
- Can track time spent on different sites and projects
- Can identify patterns in browsing behavior for productivity optimization
- Can synchronize tab states across multiple browser windows

#### The Privacy-Conscious User
**Profile**: Security professionals, privacy advocates who prioritize data control

**User Story**: "As a privacy-conscious user, I want complete control over my browsing data with encrypted local storage so that no corporation can access or monetize my information."

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- All browsing data encrypted with user-controlled keys
- No data sent to corporate servers without explicit consent
- Can export all data in open formats
- Can verify data flows through open-source components
