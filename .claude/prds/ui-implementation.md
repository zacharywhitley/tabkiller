# PRD: UI Implementation

## Executive Summary

Implement the complete browser extension user interface for TabKiller, building both the GunDB backend integration and multi-modal UI interface to deliver intelligent browsing history management. This implementation prioritizes session organization, cross-device synchronization, and privacy-first architecture through a comprehensive browser extension experience.

The UI will provide a multi-modal interface: lightweight popup for quick actions, dedicated options page for settings and device management, and specialized history viewer for full-featured browsing history exploration. The implementation follows a backend-first approach, establishing GunDB integration before building UI components on solid data foundations.

## Problem Statement

### Current Situation
TabKiller has architectural planning complete with:
- Comprehensive GunDB architecture design and specifications
- Zero-knowledge encryption integration plans  
- Real-time sync protocol definitions
- Repository layer and data model specifications
- Basic browser extension scaffold with build system

However, neither the backend implementation nor user interface exists yet, making TabKiller currently non-functional for end users.

### The Problem
Without both backend and frontend implementation, TabKiller provides no value to users:
- No browsing data capture or storage system exists
- Session organization and tagging capabilities are non-existent  
- Cross-device synchronization infrastructure is not implemented
- Privacy-focused local data control is not available
- Users have no interface to interact with browsing history

### Why Now?
With architectural planning complete, full implementation is the critical path to:
1. **MVP Completion**: Build the complete functional browser extension
2. **User Value Delivery**: Enable session organization, sync, and privacy features
3. **Technical Validation**: Prove the GunDB architecture in real-world usage
4. **Market Entry**: Launch a differentiated privacy-first browsing history solution
