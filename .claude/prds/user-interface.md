# PRD: User Interface

## Executive Summary

The tabkiller user interface provides a comprehensive solution for browser tab and window management through three interface modes: sidebar panel for quick viewing, dedicated analysis page for browsing pattern analysis, and context menus for settings. The interface enables users to visualize their browsing history as a timeline similar to git history graphs, manage current sessions with automatic and manual boundaries, and analyze browsing patterns over time. Built with React for cross-browser compatibility with offline functionality and sync via GunDB.

## Problem Statement

Current browser tab and bookmark management systems fail to address the modern user's browsing patterns:
- **Tab proliferation**: Users accumulate dozens of tabs without clear organization or purpose tracking
- **Context loss**: No way to capture the intent or story behind browsing sessions
- **Poor discoverability**: Bookmarks become graveyards; browser history is linear and unsearchable by context
- **Fragmented workflow**: No connection between current tabs, past browsing, and future reference needs
- **Cross-device chaos**: Browsing context doesn't sync meaningfully across devices and browsers

This problem is critical now because remote work and digital research have intensified information consumption, making effective browsing management essential for productivity.

## User Stories

### Primary Personas

**Research Professional (Sarah)**
- Conducts deep research sessions spanning multiple domains
- Needs to track research pathways and tag sessions by project
- Requires ability to revisit and share research trails
- Values LLM integration for synthesizing findings across sessions

**Knowledge Worker (Mike)**
- Juggles multiple projects with context switching
- Opens 20+ tabs per session, loses track of purposes
- Needs quick access to recently closed tabs and session restoration
- Wants visual indicators of tab relationships and session boundaries

**Digital Nomad (Alex)**
- Uses multiple browsers across different devices
- Needs encrypted sync of browsing context without vendor lock-in
- Values offline functionality and privacy-first approach
- Requires lightweight interface that doesn't impact performance

### Detailed User Journeys

**Journey 1: Research Session Management**
1. Sarah starts research on "sustainable urban planning" 
2. Tags session as "client-greentech-proposal"
3. Opens multiple tabs following citation trails
4. Interface shows visual graph of page relationships
5. Saves key pages with SingleFile integration
6. Asks LLM: "Summarize key themes from this research session"
7. Exports session summary and saved pages for client proposal

**Journey 2: Tab Recovery and Context Restoration**
1. Mike's browser crashes during project work
2. Opens tabkiller interface to view recent sessions
3. Sees visual timeline of last 3 hours with session tags
4. Restores specific session: "quarterly-report-research"
5. Interface recreates tab arrangement and window layout
6. Continues work without losing context or momentum

**Journey 3: Cross-Device Browsing Continuity**
1. Alex starts reading article on laptop before commute
2. Switches to mobile browser on train
3. Interface syncs via SSB, shows available sessions
4. Continues reading with full context preserved
5. Adds mobile browsing to same session thread
6. Returns to laptop with complete browsing history intact

### Pain Points Being Addressed
- **Lost context**: Visual session boundaries and tagging prevent context loss
- **Information overload**: LLM integration provides synthesis and search
- **Fragmented tools**: Unified interface replaces bookmarks + history + session managers
- **Privacy concerns**: Local-first architecture with encrypted sync
- **Vendor lock-in**: Cross-browser compatibility and open protocols

## Requirements
